          <li>Facilitate AI-generated outputs, project deployment, and integrations;</li>

        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>

        <p>For users in the European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK), we process personal data based on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your consent (e.g., newsletter or marketing opt-ins);</li>
          <li>Performance of a contract (providing the AImpact Service);</li>
          <li>Legitimate interests (improving products, security, fraud prevention);</li>
          <li>Legal compliance obligations.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>

        <p>We may share your information with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> hosting, analytics, payment, and infrastructure partners (e.g., AWS, Akash, or blockchain nodes);</li>

          However, no system is completely secure. Blockchain data, by nature, is public and immutable — once published, it cannot be deleted or altered.
