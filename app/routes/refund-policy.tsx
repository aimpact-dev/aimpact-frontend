      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 13th, 2025</p>

      <p>
        This Refund Policy explains when and how refunds may be issued for purchases made on or through
        <strong> AImpact.dev</strong> (“AImpact,” “we,” “our,” or “us”). This policy applies in addition to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
      </p>

        <h2>1) Overview</h2>
        <p>
          AImpact provides AI-powered developer tools, blockchain integrations, deployment pipelines, and related services (“Service”).
          Because many features provide immediate, automated value (e.g., AI generations, builds, deployments, and on-chain actions),
          most charges are <strong>non-refundable</strong> once consumed or initiated.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2) What’s Typically Refundable</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Duplicate charges / billing errors:</strong> If you were mistakenly charged more than once for the same item or period.</li>
          <li><strong>Failed service activation:</strong> If you paid but could not access the Service due to an issue on our side and we were unable to resolve it within a reasonable time.</li>
          <li><strong>Unauthorized transactions:</strong> If a charge was made without your authorization (subject to investigation and account security review).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3) What’s Not Refundable</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Usage-based fees:</strong> AI tokens/credits, compute minutes, build minutes, storage, bandwidth, or other metered usage once consumed.</li>
          <li><strong>Deploys and builds:</strong> Automated jobs, code generations, or deployments that have started or completed.</li>
          <li><strong>Third-party/network fees:</strong> Blockchain gas/transaction fees, validator fees, token launchpad fees, or any charges levied by third-party providers.</li>
          <li><strong>On-chain actions:</strong> Smart contract deployments or token launches; blockchain transactions are irreversible.</li>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4) Subscriptions, Trials &amp; Cancellations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Subscriptions:</strong> You may cancel at any time to stop future renewals. <em>Fees already paid for the current billing period are non-refundable</em>, unless required by law or covered under Section 2.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Free trials:</strong> If you do not cancel before the trial ends, the subscription renews automatically and the first billing cycle is non-refundable.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Downgrades:</strong> Take effect at the next billing cycle; no proration refunds unless stated otherwise in your specific plan terms.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5) EU/EEA Consumer Right of Withdrawal</h2>
        <p>
          If you are a consumer in the EU/EEA, you may have a 14-day right to withdraw from distance contracts. However, for
          <strong> digital content/services not supplied on a tangible medium</strong>, where you <strong>explicitly request immediate performance</strong>
          and acknowledge that you <strong>lose your right of withdrawal</strong> once performance begins, the withdrawal right no longer applies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because AImpact typically provides immediate access, automated AI generations, and deployments upon sign-up/purchase,
          you will be asked to consent to immediate performance and acknowledge loss of the withdrawal right when applicable.
        </p>
