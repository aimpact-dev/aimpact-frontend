# AImpact

## Description

AImpact is an AI-powered platform that makes Web3 development easy and accessible. Instead of writing code, users can simply describe their app idea in plain language â€” and AImpact turns it into a working blockchain application.

It removes the usual coding barriers, speeds up development, and still delivers secure, functional Web3 apps. 


## ICP Deployment

Users can build and deploy their app on the Internet Computer by simply describing their app idea in plain language. AImpact then turns it into a working blockchain application, which can be deployed to the Internet Computer network with one click.
